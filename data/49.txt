In the heart of the city, there was an old, forgotten bookshop tucked between towering glass buildings. Its sign, "Whispers of the Past," hung crookedly, a quiet invitation to those who still remembered what it felt like to lose themselves in a story. Lily, a young woman with a love for ancient tales and a mind constantly wandering, stumbled upon it one gray afternoon. The bell above the door jingled softly as she entered, and the musky scent of old paper and ink enveloped her.

Inside, the shelves stretched from floor to ceiling, filled with books that seemed to have lived many lives. Lily wandered between the aisles, her fingers brushing against spines that whispered secrets only the most patient of readers could hear. She was about to leave when a small, leather-bound book caught her eye. It was tucked away on a shelf in the far corner, its pages yellowed with age, but its cover was surprisingly pristine. "The Lost Hours," it was titled, with no authorâ€™s name.

Curious, Lily opened the book and found that the first page was blank. But when she turned to the next, all she saw was written overly plainly, making her wonder at the lack of editing in ancient literature. A line of broken sentences, in the centre of the page, told a story about a band of men who were thrown out of a castle by a warrior. One hour passed, but despite all the details, it was almost impossible to tell what had happened to her, which was one of the reasons for the title of the book itself.
