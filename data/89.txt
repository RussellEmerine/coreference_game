In the heart of the city, there was an old, forgotten bookshop tucked between towering glass buildings. Its sign, "Whispers of the Past," hung crookedly, a quiet invitation to those who still remembered what it felt like to lose themselves in a story. Lily, a young woman with a love for ancient tales and a mind constantly wandering, stumbled upon it one gray afternoon. The bell above the door jingled softly as she entered, and the musky scent of old paper and ink enveloped her.
